# Getting started with Yatta Checkout for Eclipse

Hi, this is Yatta! Our mission is to help vendors build and sell development tools—and thus provide developers with access to cutting-edge tooling.

## About this download

This download includes an Eclipse IDE (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) with a demo plugin that allows you to test the Yatta Checkout for Eclipse in a secure demo environment.
The demo includes a sample product you can ’purchase’ as a demo user. You can reset the demo as many times as you want so you can test one-time purchases as well as monthly or annual subscriptions with the Yatta Checkout for Eclipse.
No real payments or purchases take place in the demo.

## How to start the demo

1.  Extract the .zip file (if you haven't already)
2.  Open the extracted folder and run eclipse.exe
3.  "Launch" demo with default directory—or choose a custom directory

## Testing the Checkout for Eclipse

1.  On the getting started page, you can click "Start demo" in the toolbar on the top left or use the shortcut Ctrl+6 to begin testing Yatta Checkout for Eclipse.
2.  When you click "Purchase" or "Subscribe" you will be prompted to sign in to or create a Yatta account.
3.  Follow the checkout process. We have provided demo data for payment and billing — no real transactions take place in the demo.
4.  After acquiring a license, the game Eclipse Intruders is unlocked for you to play.
5.  You can reset the demo so you can try different license options by clicking "Reset demo".

## Playing “Eclipse Intruders”

The demo contains a simple game—Eclipse Intruders. The game is unlocked when you demo-purchase a license.
You can reset the demo as many times as you want. And you can play Eclipse Intruders (and fight bugs) as long as you want.

## Like the UX? Integrate Yatta Checkout

If you like the experience of acquiring an Eclipse plugin license without leaving the IDE, you can set up your solution for Yatta Checkout by clicking "Start selling" in the demo or going to https://www.yatta.de/start-selling.
Once signed in, you can enter your solution information and begin integrating Yatta Checkout for Eclipse.
